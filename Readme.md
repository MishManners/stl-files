# STL Files

An *.stl file is a 3D file used for 3D software and printing 3D objects.

STL stands for Standard Triangle Language. It's used by all major 3D software and hardware suppliers.

One of the coolest things about *.stl files, is they can be viewed in 3D directly on GitHub!

Choose any of the files here and play around with their 3D views.
