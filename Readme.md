# STL Files

An *.stl file is a 3D file used for 3D software and printing 3D objects.

STL stands for Standard Triangle Language. It's used by all major 3D software and hardware suppliers.

One of the coolest things about *.stl files, is they can be viewed in 3D directly on GitHub!

Choose any of the files here and play around with their 3D views.

## How to view STL files

1. Upload *.stl file
2. Click on the file in GitHub
3. Wait for the file to load
4. A 3D render of your file will appear
5. Use your mouse to navigate the file (spin, change viewing angle, zoom etc.)
6. Select different view types via the options below your file (Solid, Wireframe, Surface Angle)
